    <p>
        I am still relatively new to volleyball. I have been playing for a year. I enjoy playing indoor volleyball the best, but beach volleyball is fun sometimes.
        I'm trying to be an all around player, but I currently want to improve my passing so I can keep games going longer by keeping the ball up. But I enjoy playing as an outside hitter.
        My least favorite position to play is probably middle because you have to move around so much and you have to have good timing with your setter.
